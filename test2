Azerbaijan! Azerbaijan!
O triumphant fatherland of sons of heroes!
We are all ready to bestow our lives on thee!
We are fain to shed our very own blood for thee!
With the banner of three colors blessed be thou!
With the banner of three colors blessed be thou!

Thousands of lives were sacrificed,
Thy soul a battlefield became,
Of every soldier devoted,
Each one of them heroes became!

Blossom like a rose garden,
My life ever sworn to thee,
A thousand one loves for thee,
In my heart rooted deeply!

To stand on guard for thine honour,
Bearing aloft thy sacred flag;
To stand on guard for thine honour,
Eager be every youthful heir!
Glorious Homeland! Glorious Homeland!
Azerbaijan! Azerbaijan!
Azerbaijan! Azerbaijan!Azerbaijan
